## Problem

### While Loop

Listen

`Loops` can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
They are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.
The `while loop` loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:

Syntax:

```
 while (condition) {
     // code to be executed
 }

```

### Task

Write a program which does the following:

- Declare a int variable a and initialise it to 0.
- Use the syntax above to create a loop, output the following to the console: Print a in separate lines as long as it is less than 7. Increment a by 1 in each iteration.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {

  int a = 0;
  while (a < 7) {
    cout << a << endl;
    a = a + 1;
  }
}

```
