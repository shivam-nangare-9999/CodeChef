## Problem

### Displaying the count of elements

Listen

To get the size of an `array`, you can use the  **`sizeof()`**  operator:
For e.g.

```
int myNumbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
cout<<sizeof(myNumbers);

```

The output of above code will be 20. It is because the `sizeof()` operator returns the size of a type in bytes. `int` type is usually 4 bytes, so from the example above, 4 x 5 (4 bytes x 5 elements) = 20 bytes.

To get the number of elements in the array, you can use this code:

```
int myNumbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
cout<<sizeof(myNumbers) / sizeof(myNumbers[0]);

```

The output of the above code will be: `5`

### Task

Write a program which does the following

- Create an int array containing the elements: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60
- Compile and output to the console the accurate count of the number of integer elements in the given array.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {

  int Num[6] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60};
  cout << sizeof(Num) / 4;

  
}

```
