## Problem

### Mismatched Parenthesis

Listen

There should be one closing bracket for each opening bracket and the closing bracket should also be of the same type, like (),{},[]

If we try to use different opening and closing brackets, it can give you a syntax error.

```
int a  = (5+7 } ;     // incorrect due to the usage of mismatched parenthesis

```

### Task

We are given a program to check whether a number is odd or even.
Debug the code to solve the problem.

    if(n%2==1)
    {
        cout<<"Odd";
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<"Even";
    }       // Parenthesis here was incorrect

    
}
