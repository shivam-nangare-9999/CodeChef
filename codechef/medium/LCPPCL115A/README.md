## Problem

### Print Numbers 5 - 20

Listen

### Task

You have to print numbers from 5 to 20 in separate lines using a while loop.

- When using a loop you have to think about three things - initialisation, condition and update statement.
- So think about what we initialise the variable with? i.e., Where does the sequence start form?
- Think about what the condition will be? i.e., Till where is the sequence going?
- Also think about how the variable will be updating after every iteration. How the terms in the sequence are changing?
### Expected Output

```
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int i = 5; //Initialization statement

    while (i <= 20) { // Condition statement
        cout << i << endl;
        i++; //Update statement
    }
}
```
