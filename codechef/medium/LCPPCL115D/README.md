## Problem

### Print powers of 2

Listen

### Task

You have to print powers of $2$ from $2$ to $128$ in separate lines using a while loop:

- When using a loop you have to think about three things initialization, condition and update statement.
- So think about what we initialize the variable with? i.e., Where does the sequence start form?
- Think about what the condition will be? i.e., Till where is the sequence going?
- Also think about how the variable will be updating after every iteration. How the terms in the sequence are changing?
### Expected Output

```
2
4
8
16
32
64
128

```

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n = 128;
    //Initialization: set i to the starting value
    int i = 2;
    //Condition: keep repeating till less than equal to n
    while (i <= n) {
        //Output i(current number)
        cout << i << endl;
        // Update Statement: At each iteration multiply i(current number) by 2
        i *= 2;
    }
}
```
