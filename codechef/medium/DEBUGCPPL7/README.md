## Problem

### Logical Error or Wrong Answer (WA)

Listen

A logical error is an error in a program that occurs when the code compiles and runs without producing any error messages, but it does not produce the expected or desired output.
Instead, it performs a different computation or provides incorrect results due to a flaw in the algorithm or logic of the program.
Logical errors are the hardest to find in a program.

Based on what you have learnt so far - you will encounter logical errors of the following types:

- Incorrect Conditions
- Incorrect Index
- Incorrect variable usage

    if(b==0) {
        cout<<"infinity\n";
    }
    else {
        cout<<a/b<<"\n";
    }
